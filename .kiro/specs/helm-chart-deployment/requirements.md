# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature adds a comprehensive Helm chart for deploying the Siman Ban dashboard application to Kubernetes clusters. The chart will provide configurable deployment options for the Next.js frontend application with proper service exposure, API gateway integration, and HTTPRoute configuration for external access. This enables consistent, scalable deployment across different environments (development, staging, production) with infrastructure-as-code practices.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want a Helm chart for the Siman Ban dashboard, so that I can deploy the application consistently across different Kubernetes environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I install the Helm chart THEN the system SHALL create a Kubernetes deployment with configurable replica count
2. WHEN I configure the values.yaml file THEN the system SHALL use the specified container image and tag
3. WHEN the deployment is created THEN the system SHALL include proper resource limits and requests
4. WHEN the deployment is created THEN the system SHALL include environment variables for Supabase configuration
5. WHEN the deployment is created THEN the system SHALL include proper health checks and readiness probes

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want a Kubernetes service for the dashboard deployment, so that the application pods can be accessed internally within the cluster.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Helm chart is installed THEN the system SHALL create a ClusterIP service by default
2. WHEN I configure the service type in values.yaml THEN the system SHALL create the specified service type (ClusterIP, NodePort, LoadBalancer)
3. WHEN the service is created THEN the system SHALL target the correct deployment pods using proper selectors
4. WHEN the service is created THEN the system SHALL expose port 3000 (Next.js default port)
5. WHEN I configure custom ports in values.yaml THEN the system SHALL use the specified port configuration

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want API Gateway and HTTPRoute configuration, so that external users can access the dashboard through a controlled ingress point.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I enable API Gateway in values.yaml THEN the system SHALL create a Gateway resource
2. WHEN I configure the gateway host in values.yaml THEN the system SHALL use the specified hostname
3. WHEN I configure gateway listeners THEN the system SHALL create proper HTTPS and HTTP listeners
4. WHEN the HTTPRoute is created THEN the system SHALL route traffic to the dashboard service
5. WHEN I configure custom paths in values.yaml THEN the system SHALL use the specified path routing rules
6. WHEN I configure TLS settings THEN the system SHALL include proper certificate references

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want configurable values through values.yaml, so that I can customize the deployment for different environments without modifying templates.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I modify replica count in values.yaml THEN the deployment SHALL scale to the specified number of replicas
2. WHEN I change the container image in values.yaml THEN the deployment SHALL use the specified image and tag
3. WHEN I configure resource limits in values.yaml THEN the pods SHALL have the specified CPU and memory constraints
4. WHEN I set environment variables in values.yaml THEN the pods SHALL include the specified environment configuration
5. WHEN I configure ingress settings in values.yaml THEN the HTTPRoute SHALL use the specified host and path configuration
6. WHEN I set service configuration in values.yaml THEN the service SHALL use the specified type and port settings

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the Helm chart to support different deployment environments, so that I can deploy to development, staging, and production with appropriate configurations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I use development values THEN the system SHALL deploy with minimal resources and debug settings
2. WHEN I use staging values THEN the system SHALL deploy with moderate resources and staging-specific configuration
3. WHEN I use production values THEN the system SHALL deploy with production-grade resources and security settings
4. WHEN I specify environment-specific Supabase URLs THEN the application SHALL connect to the correct backend
5. WHEN I configure environment-specific domains THEN the HTTPRoute SHALL route to the correct hostname

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want proper security and best practices in the Helm chart, so that the deployed application follows Kubernetes security standards.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the deployment is created THEN the system SHALL run containers as non-root user
2. WHEN the deployment is created THEN the system SHALL include security context with appropriate settings
3. WHEN secrets are needed THEN the system SHALL support Kubernetes secrets for sensitive configuration
4. WHEN the pods are created THEN the system SHALL include proper labels and annotations for monitoring
5. WHEN network policies are enabled THEN the system SHALL include appropriate network security rules
